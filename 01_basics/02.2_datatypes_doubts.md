# Mutable and Immutable datatypes in JavaScript

**Question:**

In JavaScript, consider the following code:

```javascript
let userName = "Milan Kharel";
userName = "Meelan";
```

1. Memory is initially allocated for `userName` with the value `"Milan Kharel"`. When I update the value of `userName` to `"Meelan"`, does the value in the same memory location change, or is a new memory location allocated for `userName`?

2. If a new memory location is allocated, what happens to the previous value `"Milan Kharel"` that was stored in the original memory location?

### Answer:

In JavaScript, variables are references to values, and how those values are stored in memory depends on the type of the variable.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of what happens when you reassign the value of `userName`:

1. **When `let userName = "Milan Kharel";` is executed**:

   - A new memory location is allocated to store the string value `"Milan Kharel"`.
   - The variable `userName` is now referencing that memory location.

2. **When `userName = "Meelan";` is executed**:
   - The variable `userName` is now reassigned to a new string value `"Meelan"`.
   - In JavaScript, strings are immutable, so a new memory location is created to store the new value `"Meelan"`. The previous string `"Milan Kharel"` is no longer referenced by `userName`.

### What happens to the old value (`"Milan Kharel"`)?

- After the reassignment, `"Milan Kharel"` is no longer referenced by the variable `userName`. However, if there are no other references to the string `"Milan Kharel"`, the JavaScript engine will eventually consider it **garbage** and free up that memory (via garbage collection).

In summary:

- **Yes**, a new memory address is created for the new string value `"Meelan"`.
- The previous value `"Milan Kharel"` is no longer accessible through `userName`, and it will eventually be cleared from memory if there are no other references to it.

**Question:**

Is the immutability behavior in JavaScript specific to strings, or does it apply to all data types? The data types include:

1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

### Answer:

In JavaScript, the behavior you've described applies specifically to **primitive types** and **objects**. Let's break it down for each of the data types you listed:

### 1. **String** (Primitive type)

- **Immutable**: Strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created. When you reassign a string, a new string is created in memory rather than modifying the existing string.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello";
    str = "World"; // A new string is created
    ```

### 2. **Number** (Primitive type)

- **Immutable**: Numbers are also immutable. When you reassign a number, you are creating a new value in memory.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let num = 42;
    num = 100; // A new number value is created
    ```

### 3. **BigInt** (Primitive type)

- **Immutable**: BigInt is a relatively new primitive type for handling arbitrarily large integers. Like other primitives, it is immutable.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let bigNum = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    bigNum = 9876543210987654321098765432109876543210n; // New BigInt created
    ```

### 4. **Boolean** (Primitive type)

- **Immutable**: Booleans are immutable. When you reassign a boolean value, a new value is created.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let isTrue = true;
    isTrue = false; // A new boolean value is created
    ```

### 5. **Undefined** (Primitive type)

- **Immutable**: `undefined` is a special primitive value representing the absence of a value. You can assign `undefined` to variables, but it is immutable, meaning it can’t be changed once assigned.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let x;
    x = undefined; // `undefined` is a single immutable value
    ```

### 6. **Null** (Primitive type)

- **Immutable**: `null` is a primitive value representing the intentional absence of any object value. It’s also immutable.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let obj = null;
    obj = null; // `null` is immutable
    ```

### 7. **Symbol** (Primitive type)

- **Immutable**: Symbols are unique and immutable values primarily used to create anonymous object properties. Once created, symbols cannot be changed.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const sym1 = Symbol("description");
    const sym2 = Symbol("description"); // Different symbol, immutable
    ```

### 8. **Object** (Non-primitive type)

- **Mutable**: Objects (including arrays, functions, and other complex types) are **mutable**. This means you can modify the contents (properties or elements) of an object even if the reference to the object itself is unchanged.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
    person.age = 31; // The object is mutated, not a new object created
    ```

### Key Takeaways

- **Primitives** in JavaScript (e.g., String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol) are **immutable**. When you "change" a primitive, a new value is created, and the old one is discarded (if there are no other references to it).
- **Objects** (including Arrays, Functions, and other complex data structures) are **mutable**. You can modify the contents of an object, and the reference to the object remains the same.
  - For example, if you modify an object or an array, you're changing the internal state of the object, not creating a new reference.

In conclusion, JavaScript distinguishes between **primitive types** (which are immutable) and **objects** (which are mutable). This distinction is key to understanding how JavaScript handles memory and variable assignment.
